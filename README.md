# Dynamic Pressure
### Plot of the dynamic pressure the Space Shuttle (or similar launch vehicle) would see as a function of time

An average acceleration of 51.76 ft/s^2 (18,000 mph [velocity at orbit] / 8.5 minutes [time to orbit]) was initially used, and then I added a couple of other accelerations to see how the plot changed.
